# Hyperion Capstone Projects

 A collection of projects completed during my Hyperion Development Data Science Bootcamp between 1st-Nov-2022 and 10th-Jan-2023. These projects cover a range of topics such as basic object oriented programming, exploratory data analysis, SQL databases and Machine learning algorithms.

 Project|Description
 ---|---
 `1-VariableControl/`| A simple command-line multi-use calculator that can be used to calculate the money gained on an investment or the amount you would have to pay back on a house loan.
 `2-TaskManager/`|A simple command line based task manager that I was tasked to refactor and expand upon. Users can create tasks with given deadlines, descriptions, and assign users. There is an admin user that is able to generate general statistics about the tasks on the system as well as write automatic reports about the tasks.
`3-AutomobileAnalysis/`|An exploratory data analysis of a dataset containing information about different vehicles.
`4-PenguinAnalysis/`|An exploratory analysis of a dataset containing information about types of penguins found on 3 different islands.
`5-Ebookstore/`|A command line inventory system for a book store that uses SQLite to store the data in a local database file `ebookstore.db`. Once running, the application allows for the user to add books into the inventory, update the inventory, delete books, and search for books in the inventory.  
`6-MLRandomForest/`|A demonstration on using [SciKit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to train and tune a [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) machine learning model. The model was trained using the [MNIST handwritten digit](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data-set to recognise written numbers.
`7-MLClustering/`|A demonstration on using PCA to simplify a dataset, then comparing the [K-mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) and [Hierarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering) clustering algorithms. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kurohana/usarrets) used contains crime statistics for each US state. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) was used for the clustering algorithms.

Thank you to [Hyperion Development](https://www.hyperiondev.com/) for providing me with the resources used for these projects and all the other tasks completed during the bookcamp.
